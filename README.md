# The (in)famous NEW\_VERSION\_FORCED, on your own Discord server.

Monitoring current forced version of Pokémon Go.

You need to add the bot to your server using the following link:


[Add to server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=563941014126067713&scope=bot&permissions=469969976)


# Usage

Add the bot to your server, then:

* `!notify_channel #channel_name` to set the channel to receive notification when a forced update happens.
* `!format ...$version...` to set the format of the message.
* `!info` to retrieve the current notification channel and format.
* `!test` to test the current configuration.

# Permission

This bot requires initial `Administrator` permission to work. It will create a private config channel which only members with `Administrator` permission can see. After the bot is added and the channel is created, you can remove `Administrator` permission but you must configure so that the bot can still see the config channel.

If you didn't allow `Administrator` permission, simply kick the bot and re-add.
